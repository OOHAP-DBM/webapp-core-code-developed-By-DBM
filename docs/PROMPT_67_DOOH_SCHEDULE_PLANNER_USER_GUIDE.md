**Example:**

```

### Step 3: Set Schedule Period

**Date Range:**
```
Start Date: [Select date - must be at least 1 day in future]
End Date: [Select date]
```

**Tips:**
- 📅 Minimum 1 day notice required
- 📅 Longer campaigns get volume discounts
- 📅 Peak seasons may have limited availability

### Step 4: Configure Playtime Slots

You have three options:

#### Option A: 24/7 Playback (Recommended)
- ✅ Your ad plays throughout the day
- ✅ Maximum exposure
- ✅ Simplest option

#### Option B: Daily Time Range
- ⏰ Choose specific hours each day
- 📊 Example: 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM
- 💰 More cost-effective
- 🎯 Target peak hours

**Example:**
```
Start Time: 08:00 AM
End Time: 08:00 PM
Your ad plays 12 hours daily
```

#### Option C: Custom Time Slots
- 🎯 Define multiple time windows
- 📍 Precision targeting
- 💡 Best for peak hour campaigns

**Example:**
```
Slot 1: 08:00 AM - 12:00 PM (Morning rush)

```

### Step 5: Set Loop Frequency

**Displays Per Hour:**
```
[Slider: 1 ----------- 60]
Recommended: 12 displays/hour
```

**What this means:**
- **12 displays/hour** = Your ad shows every 5 minutes
- **6 displays/hour** = Your ad shows every 10 minutes
- **30 displays/hour** = Your ad shows every 2 minutes

**Choosing Frequency:**
- 🟢 **Low (6-10/hour):** Budget-friendly, moderate exposure
- 🟡 **Medium (12-20/hour):** Balanced exposure and cost
- 🔴 **High (24-60/hour):** Maximum visibility, higher cost

### Step 6: Select Active Days

**All Days:** ☑️ Monday through Sunday

**Or Select Specific Days:**
- ☐ Monday
- ☐ Tuesday
- ☐ Wednesday
- ☐ Thursday
- ☐ Friday
- ☐ Saturday
- ☐ Sunday

**Use Cases:**
- 📅 **Weekdays Only:** Target office commuters

### Step 7: Review Summary

```
📊 Schedule Summary

Total Days: 30 days
Displays Per Day: 288

```

**Calculation:**

8,640 displays × ₹2.50 = ₹21,600
```
